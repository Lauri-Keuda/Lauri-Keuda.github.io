# Discord bot
Here I will tell about simple discord bot I made using python.
![discord bot]({discordBot})

## Larw's Bot

I used youtube tutorial to make this bot.
It doesn't have many features because I didn't have the motivation to continue it.

When the bot is runing you can use it with couple of simple commands.
First command you would wanna use is *help* to get list of all possible commands.
Bot gives you this response:

```
Hei:    tervehdys
roll:    nopan heitto
credits:    tekijä
help:    tämä
```

I have to mention, that the bot doesn't care if you start with capitalized letter or not.
Now that we know all the commands there is I'm just going to list then here.

**Hei**

`Hei siellä`

**roll**

Gives random number between 1-6

`e.g. *5*`

**credits**

> Tämän botin on tehnyt *Larw*

There is all the commands but there is still one cool feature.
Up to this point we have used these commands in some discord server but if we want we can get the response in private message.
It work by putting exclamation mark at the beginig of the command. Like this `!roll`.
Now the bot will send the response directly to you and not to the channel you used the command.
![private message from the bot]({discordBot})

## Some things from the code

```
import random

def handle_response(message) -> str:
    p_message = message.lower()

    if p_message == 'hei':
        return 'Hei siellä!'

    if p_message == 'roll':
        return str(random.randint(1, 6))

    if p_message == 'help':
        return "```Hei:\ttervehdys\nroll:\tnopan heitto\ncredits:\ttekijä\nhelp:\ttämä```"

    if p_message == 'credits':
        return ">>> Tämän botin on tehnyt *Larw*"

    else:
        return ""
```

```
import discord
import responses

async def send_message(message, user_message, is_private):
    try:
        response = responses.handle_response(user_message)
        if is_private:
            await message.author.send(response)
        else:
            await message.channel.send(response)

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

def run_discord_bot():
    TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    intents = discord.Intents.default()
    intents.message_content = True
    client = discord.Client(intents=intents)

    @client.event
    async def on_ready():
        print(f'{client.user} is now running!')

    @client.event
    async def on_message(message):
        if message.author == client.user:
            return

        username = str(message.author)
        user_message = str(message.content)
        channel = str(message.channel)

        print(f"{username} said: '{user_message}' ({channel})")

        if user_message[0] == '?':
            user_message = user_message[1:]
            await send_message(message, user_message, is_private=True)
        else:
            await send_message(message, user_message, is_private=False)

    client.run(TOKEN)
